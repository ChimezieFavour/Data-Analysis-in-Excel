# Data Analysis in Excel

This repository contains my first set of Excel projects completed while learning Excel through a YouTube course.  
It showcases my progress in using Excel for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Projects Included
- **Sales Dashboard**: Built using PivotTables, charts, and slicers to analyze sales performance.  
- **Expense Tracker**: Applied formulas like SUMIF, VLOOKUP, and used conditional formatting.  
- **Student Grades Analysis**: Used formulas and conditional formatting to evaluate student results.  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data Cleaning in Excel  
- Using PivotTables and PivotCharts  
- Conditional Formatting  
- Basic Excel Formulas and Functions (SUM, AVERAGE, VLOOKUP, etc.)  


### Project: Data cleaning, PivotTables & Dashboard (YouTube practice)
**File:** `Excel Project Dataset.xlsx`

**What I did**
- Cleaned data using filters and Remove Duplicates  
- Used Find & Replace (Ctrl + H) for bulk text fixes  
- Built nested IF formulas to create calculated columns  
- Created 4 PivotTables and matching charts  
- Designed a dashboard with aligned charts and added slicers for interactivity

**How to explore**
Open the workbook and check the worksheets in order (Raw Dataset → Working Sheet → Pivot Table → Dashboard).
